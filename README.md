## What we're building

A To-Do List, with tests in the console checking different aspects of the site.

## User Journey

- Arrives on site
- Tests Run in the background logging to the console
- If previously visited will then load old to do items for them
- Can add new items
- Check items off their to do list
- Can uncheck items back to their to do list
- Delete items fully from their list

## User Stories

As busy person, I want to:

* Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
* Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
* Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore
* Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do
* Be able to have the site save my list so I can come back to it

As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

* Use all the features of the app without a mouse

## Schedule

* Tuesday 8: meet to discuss progress and next steps
* Wednesday 9: working MVP
* Thursday 10: final touches, final accessibility checks
