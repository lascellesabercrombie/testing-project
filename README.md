## User Journey

- User arrives on site
- Tests run in the background logging to the console
- If the user has previously visited, the site will then load old to-do items for them
- User can add new items
- User can check items off their to-do list and into a separate area of the page
- User can uncheck items back to their to-do list
- User can delete items fully from their list

## User Stories

As busy person, I want to:

* Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
* Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
* Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore
* Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do
* Be able to have the site save my list so I can come back to it

As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

* Use all the features of the app without a mouse

## Design

The name NotePerfect pointed in a musical direction and so the design took inspiration from the distinctive yellow and green design of G. Schirmer's books of sheet music. Sections of the webpage are divided by a decoration inspired by a musical stave. 

## Possibilities for Further Development

* Categorisation of list items
* Nested list items
* Give the user basic styling choices over their notes
