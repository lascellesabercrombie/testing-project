## User Stories

As busy person, I want to:

* Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
* Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
* Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore
* Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

* Use all the features of the app without a mouse

## Schedule

* Tuesday 8: meet to discuss progress and next steps
* Wednesday 9: working MVP
* Thursday 10: final touches, final accessibility checks
